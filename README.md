# Code Challenge: String Manipulation

This repository contains a Java solution for the "String Manipulation" code challenge. The challenge consists of several tasks related to manipulating strings, including reversing word order, removing duplicate characters, finding the longest palindrome substring, capitalizing the first letter of each sentence, and checking if a string is an anagram of a palindrome.

## Tasks

The code provides solutions for the following tasks:

1. Reversing the order of words in a sentence while maintaining word order.
2. Removing duplicate characters from a string.
3. Finding the longest palindrome substring in a given string.
4. Capitalizing the first letter of each sentence in a string.
5. Checking if a string is an anagram of a palindrome.

## Example

Here's an example of the code in action:

```java
String input = "Hello, World! OpenAI is amazing.";
String reversedWords = StringManipulation.reverseWords(input);
System.out.println(reversedWords);
// Output: "amazing. is OpenAI World! Hello,"
